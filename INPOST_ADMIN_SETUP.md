# InPost Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ **Critical Fix Applied**

The InPost method detection has been fixed. The issue was that the frontend was looking for specific names like "inpost locker" but your admin created a method named just "Inpost". Now it detects any method containing "inpost" in the name or provider ID.
